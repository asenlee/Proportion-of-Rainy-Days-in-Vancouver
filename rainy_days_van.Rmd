# Introduction



# Codes and Analysis

Load Dataset
```{r}
data <- read.csv("combined_weather.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
