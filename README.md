# Proportion of Rainy Days in Vancouver per Year

Vancouver is known to be a rainy city, and as students attending UBC, it is only natural for us to wonder what proportion of days it actually rains, or the average number of rainy days per year. I will conduct an analysis on Vancouver weather data over the past 83 years to estimate the total proportion of rainy days in Vancouver’s history, and the mean number of days per year where it rains over 10mm. 

I will use both SRS and Stratified Sampling as our methods to draw from a dataset of daily Vancouver International Airport weather data from 1937–2020.
